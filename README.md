# Symfony Blog

To get started with PHP development, my internship company gave me the task to build a simple Symfony API with some CRUD operations to an SQL database. I decided to build a very simple blog

## I learned

- Using PHP in a back-end scenario
- Using Symfony with Doctrine to build an API
